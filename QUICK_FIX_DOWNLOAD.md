# 🚨 QUICK FIX: Download URLs Still Showing Localhost

## ❌ **Current Problem:**
- Download links still show `localhost:3001`
- Files can't be downloaded from Discord
- Backend is running locally

## ✅ **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:**

### **Option 1: Deploy to Render (Recommended)**
1. **Go to [Render.com](https://render.com)**
2. **Connect your GitHub repo**: `PakGhostGamer/dashtool`
3. **Deploy as Web Service**
4. **Get your hosted URL** (e.g., `https://amazon-dashboard-backend.onrender.com`)

### **Option 2: Test with Local Network (Quick Test)**
If you want to test immediately:

1. **Find your computer's IP address:**
   ```bash
   ipconfig
   ```
   Look for: `IPv4 Address: 192.168.x.x`

2. **Update config.js:**
   ```javascript
   downloadDomain: 'http://192.168.x.x:3001'  // Replace with your IP
   ```

3. **Restart backend server**

## 🔧 **What I Fixed in the Code:**

1. **✅ Added `downloadDomain` config** - Easy to change domain
2. **✅ Updated render.yaml** - Ready for deployment
3. **✅ Fixed server logic** - Uses configured domain

## 🚀 **After Deployment to Render:**

**Download URLs will change from:**
```
http://localhost:3001/api/download/1755227507749_p696ldn4x
```

**To:**
```
https://amazon-dashboard-backend.onrender.com/api/download/1755227507749_p696ldn4x
```

## 📱 **Result:**

- ✅ **Download links work everywhere**
- ✅ **Files downloadable from Discord**
- ✅ **Production ready**
- ✅ **No more localhost issues**

## 🎯 **NEXT STEP:**

**Deploy to Render now to fix the download issue!**

Your code is ready - just deploy and the localhost problem will be solved! 🚀
